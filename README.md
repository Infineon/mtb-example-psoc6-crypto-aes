# PSoC 6 MCU Cryptography: AES Demonstration

This code example encrypts and decrypts user input data using the AES algorithm using a 128-bit key. The encrypted and decrypted data are displayed on a UART terminal emulator.

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox™ IDE](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-software-environment) v2.0
- Programming Language: C  
- Associated Parts: All PSoC® 6 MCU [parts](https://www.cypress.com/PSoC6)


## Supported Kits

- [PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062-WiFi-BT) (CY8CKIT-062-WiFi-BT)
- [PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062-BLE) (CY8CKIT-062-BLE)
- [PSoC 6 BLE Prototyping Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CPROTO-063-BLE) (CY8CPROTO-063-BLE)
- [PSoC 62S2 Wi-Fi BT Pioneer Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062S2-43012) (CY8CKIT-062S2-43012)

## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure the board is configured correctly.

**Note**: The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

## Using the Code Example

### In ModusToolbox IDE

1. Click the **New Application** link in the Quick Panel (or, use **File > New > ModusToolbox IDE Application**).

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **IDE Application** dialog. 

   When you select a supported kit the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the **Library Manager** to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, right-click the application name from the Project Workspace window in the IDE, and select **ModusToolbox > Library Manager**. For more details, see the IDE User Guide, available in *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_2.0/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit. 

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Starter Application** window, choose the example.

4. Click **Next** and complete the application creation process.

See [Importing Code Example into ModusToolbox IDE - KBA225201](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-15968) for details.


### In Command-line Interface (CLI)

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

3. Import required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.  

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board. 

   ### Using ModusToolbox IDE

   1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.
   
   2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**. 

   ### Using CLI

   1. From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
        ```
        make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
        ```
        Example:

        ```
        make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
        ```
        **Note**:  Before building the application, ensure the *libs* folder contains the BSP (.lib) file corresponding to the TARGET. Execute `make getlibs` to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.
    
4. Press the reset button on the kit and enter the message to be encrypted. Note that in this example, the maximum message size is restricted to 100 characters. If you need to increase the message size, change the macro MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE to the message size that you require.

5. Observe the results in the terminal window (see [Figure 1](#figure-1-sample-output-showing-AES-encryption)).

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the ModusToolbox IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. See [KBA224621](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-15763) to learn  how to start a debug session with ModusToolbox IDE.

## Design and Implementation

AES is a symmetric block cipher data encryption algorithm, which means that it uses the same key for encryption and decryption of data. The AES operation works on 128-bit block size and uses keys of 128 bits, 192 bits, or 256 bits of length.
In this example, the user input message is read from the UART terminal and encrypted using the AES algorithm with a key length of 128 bits. The 128-bit encrypted data is displayed on the UART terminal. Then, you can view the decrypted message on the UART terminal and verify that the decryption operation produces the same original encrypted message.
